## Tech:

# starting out with the following for the client folder

- npx create-react-app client

# install and setting up Apollo Client

- Library that Apollo created for making requests to GraphQl APIs using Apollo Server. Designed to support managing state for a React front end.

npm i @apollo/client graphql

@apollo/client - an all-in-one dependency that enables us to connect to a GraphQL API server and execute queries or mutations using their own special form of React Hooks

graphql - is a dependency much like MySQL2 was for Sequelize. Don't use it directly, but it needs to be present so that the GraphQL syntax used with Apollo Client can be understood.
